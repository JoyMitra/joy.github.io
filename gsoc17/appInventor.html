<h1 id="design-challenge">Design Challenge</h1>
<p>This challenge involved solving two problems with respect to the code base of AppInventor.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>AppInventor has a component called Camera which allowed users to open a front camera by default. However, this feature stopped working on newer versions of android. The first part of the challenge required us to find out the reason for it. I figured that the problem lies in the takePicture() method in <a href="https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources/blob/master/appinventor/components/src/com/google/appinventor/components/runtime/Camera.java">Camera.java</a>. The TakePicture() invokes Camera via the IMAGE_CAPTURE implicit intent. The Camera.java class has a property called <em>userFront</em>. The TakePicture() method checks if <em>useFront</em> is set to true. If it is set to true then it adds an <em>extra</em> to the intent that invokes Camera with the statement <em>intent.putExtra(&quot;android.intent.extras.CAMERA_FACING&quot;, 1)</em>. This indicates that the front camera should open by default if the property is set to true. However, the &quot;android.intent.extras.CAMERA_FACING&quot; is an undocumented feature in Android and does not work for newer versions of Android. Since, newer android stopped supporting this feature <em>useFront</em> stopped working and had to be removed from AppInventor.</p></li>
<li><p>The second part of the challenge required us to design a feature that would allow users to automatically take pictures. To implement this feature all we need to do is add a method in the class Camera.java (discussed in the point 1) and annotate it with <em><span class="citation">@SimpleFunction</span></em>. Lets call this function <em>TakePictureAuto()</em>. Inside this method we use the Camera API to automatically click a picture, store it in internal storage and trigger the <em>AfterPicture</em> event just like in <em>TakePicture()</em>. Note it is important to annotate <em>TakePictureAuto()</em> with <em><span class="citation">@SimpleFunction</span></em> because that would make it visible to the user in the Blocks editor, allowing her to invoke this function from the blocks editor. Following is a code snippet for TakePictureAuto:
    <img src="snippet1.png"/>
    <img src="snippet2.png"/>
  </p></li> 
</ol>
<p><em>Note I use internal storage to save the image as opposed to external storage because saving in internal stroage is more secure. The TakePicture() method stores images in external storage though. I could have done the same but I am not sure why that is required. Maybe I am missing a nuance which is why I am documenting it.</em></p>

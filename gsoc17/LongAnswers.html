<h2 id="Q1">Interest in App Inventor</h2>
<p>For quite some time I have been interested in the democratization of software. I have seen so many people come up with cool
  ideas but stop at that because they did not have the skills to implement them. In some sense, making software has become easier
  over the years with evolving programming languages and tools. However, programming languages can still seem daunting to some. 
  App Inventor tries to bridge that gap by providing a visual platform where making apps is like solving a puzzle. This 
  is what attracted me to App Inventor. Also, my own research is closely related to this idea. Security is a big concern these days.
  A large class of security vulnerabilities are due to errors in code. As part of my research I am currently designing a methodology
  that will enable developers to specify mobile apps in a visual language, perform security analysis and generate source code -- secure by construction. 
  I believe that working for App Inventor over the summer will give me ideas about my own research since I am also thinking of a visual platform for my methodology</p>

<h2 id="Q1">Interest in App Inventor</h2>
<p>Programming languages can seem daunting to some. App Inventor tries to bridge that gap by providing a visual platform where making apps is like solving a puzzle. This 
  is what attracted me to App Inventor. Also, my own research is closely related to this idea. Security is a big concern these days.
  A large class of security vulnerabilities are due to errors in code. As part of my research I am currently designing a methodology
  that will enable developers to specify mobile apps in a visual language, perform security analysis and generate source code -- secure by construction. 
  I believe that working for App Inventor over the summer will give me ideas about my own research since I am also thinking of a visual platform for my methodology</p>

<h2 id="Q2">Proposed summer project</h2>
 <h4>Synopsis</h4>

<p>
  Components are the building blocks of app inventor. They can be visible i.e. they are part of UI interface or they can be non visible i.e they are not part of the UI screen but provide access to built-in functions of the device. All components in app inventor are part of some screen or activity which means that if the screen is not visible or the screen is destroyed by the Android system, the components stop running. An example of this is the Pedometer component which stops running when the phone screen is off. Ideally, a pedometer app would want to keep running once started in the background until the user of the app explicitly stops it. To enable such behavior it is necessary to run such components on a thread separate from the UI thread in the background.  
</p>
<h4>Benefits to community</h4>
  <p>
    Enabling components to run in a background process will allow app inventor developers to build more sophisticated apps. By leveraging the ability to schedule tasks to run in the background, developing with app inventor will take the community a step closer to native android development.  
  </p>
  <h4>Deliverables and Timeline</h4>
  <p>
    The project can be divided into a clear set of tasks that need to be achieved. In the following points I list out what needs to be done:
  </p>  
  <ul>
    <li>Android provides a number of APIs to schedule tasks that need to run outside of the scope of the application’s lifecycle. We will need to research each one of those and decide whether some or all will be a good fit for app inventor. Following is a brief description of each:
      <ol>
        <li>The <b>Service API</b> provides helper functions through which a background process or a service can be created, started or stopped. However, if the main application process inside which the service runs is killed, the Android system will kill the service as well. This is fine for most cases but sometimes a background process will need to keep running even if the main application process is killed e.g. pedometer. In such cases we can use the following approach:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>a broadcast receiver to re-start the service every time it gets destroyed. When the system decides to kill a process it kills all the components associated with it. Before destroying each component, the system invokes the onDestory() method to check if anything needs to be done before destorying the component. For an activity we can override onDestroy() and stop the service. When a service is stopped, we can trigger the broadcast receiver and re-start the service. This way we can ensure that any service keeps running in the background. If we want the service to remember some data we could save the data in internal storage when the service is destroyed and read it from there every time the service restarts. A downside to this approach is that this could take a toll on the battery and some mechanism needs to be worked out that will eventually stop the service (e.g. some logic inside onDestory() that will not trigger the broadcast receiver based on some conditions). </li>
          </ul>
        <li>The <b>Alarm Manager API</b> allows access to system level alarms. It is typically used to trigger a Pending Intent that is used to start a service in the future. It is a good candidate if a background operation needs to be done at a particular time or during some interval. However, the documentation states that it is not a good candidate for scheduling network related jobs.</li>
        <li>The <b>Job Scheduler API</b> is used to schedule background tasks based on certain criteria like low battery, connected to a metered network, device is idle etc.  This is a good candidate for scheduling long running network operations in the background. However, it is only available for devices running Android API level 21 and higher.</li>
        <li>For older API levels Android provides the <b>GCM Network Manager</b>. This API is similar to Job Scheduler. Both the Job Scheduler API and GCM Network Manager are optimized to save battery. </li>
        <li>The <b>Sync Adapter API</b> is used to sync local data on the device with a server</li>
      </ol>
      <p><i>This should take about 2 weeks.</i></p>
    </li>
    <li>Design a generic framework in app inventor that would allow non visible components to be scheduled.
      <ol>
        <li>We will need to design a new component that will provide methods for performing long running background operations . The methods will provide a handle to the APIs discussed above. This new component will probably extend the NonVisibleComponent class.</li>
        <li>It is possible that long lived processes generate some data. We can save the generated data in internal storage of the app.</li>
        <li>The background process might want to inform the UI of its progress or it might want to send some data to the UI for display. We will need to create a notification event that the background process can dispatch. </li>
        <li>The internal file-system will have to be exposed in the designer as a non visible component. The blocks editor will provide some properties and methods that will enable the reading and writing of files in internal storage. </li>
        <li>A property in the new component that will enable users to specify from the blocks editor if they want a non-visible component to run some operations in the background outside the scope of the application’s lifecycle.</li>
        <li>Components that need to run outside the scope of the application’s lifecycle will have to extend the new component in bullet a.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><i>This should take about 4 weeks.</i></p>
    </li>
    <li>Create a prototype based on the above design.<p><i>This should take about 3 weeks.</i></p></li>
    <li>Write automated unit tests to verify intended behavior. Since, the implementation will be Java, JUnit will be a good fit.<p><i>This should take about 2 weeks.</i></p></li>
    <li>Document the framework<p><i>This should take about 1 week.</i></p>.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="Q3">Interest in introductory programming</h2>
<p>I have about 3 years professional experience making web applications using Java, JSP/Servlet, Ajax, JavaScript. In my graduate program I have worked
  extensively on Anroid. I developed an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.ksu.cis.bse_a4m_android&hl=en">app</a> available in Google Play.
  The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/JoyMitra/apps-4-vet-med/tree/master/bse-a4vm/android">here</a>. I have also dabbled with compiler technology and built a compiler for Extended Static Java
  along with a transpiler that translates Extended Static Java Programs into C. I also built a Garbage Collector for C programs. The source code is availabe <a href="https://github.com/JoyMitra/Java2CTranspiler">here</a>.
  I have also written automated tests (JUnit) for all my projects. A sample of Android tests are available <a href="https://github.com/JoyMitra/apps-4-vet-med/tree/master/bse-a4vm/android/app/src/androidTest/java/edu/ksu/cs/a4vm/bse">here</a>.
  A sample of tests I wrote for the JavaToC Transpiler are available <a href="https://github.com/JoyMitra/Java2CTranspiler/blob/master/compiler-team-project/src/test/java/esj/test/CcodegeneratorTest.java">here</a>.
  I am currently working on vulnerability analysis in Android. It is a private repository hence I cannot share it publicly for now. 
  If you want to see samples of the work I have done there, you can send me a private email and I can share some of it. I have also been
  working on a design methodology for building secure Android apps. Here is a link to the <a href="https://joymitra.github.io/preventive-approach-securing.pdf">vision paper</a>
  As an aside I have been a teaching assistant on courses involving C programming and automated software testing.</p>

<h2 id="Q4">Experience with development tools</h2>
<p>I have worked on Eclipse, IntelliJ, Android Studio, Bash Shell, Code Analysis tools like Lint and PMD, Testing frameworks like JUnit and Pytest</p>

<h2 id="Q5">Experience with teams, online developer communities, and large code bases</h2>
<p>I worked for 3.5 years for a large software company. I was part of 2 large teams there. Also, always I had to make enhancements to existing code bases. I am used to setting up and going through large codebases</p>

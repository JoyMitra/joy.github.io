<h2 id="Q1">Interest in App Inventor</h2>
<p>For quite some time I have been interested in the democratization of software. I have seen so many people come up with cool
  ideas but stop at that because they did not have the skills to implement them. In some sense, making software has become easier
  over the years with evolving programming languages and tools. However, programming languages can still seem daunting to some. 
  App Inventor tries to bridge that gap by providing a visual platform where making apps is like solving a puzzle. This 
  is what attracted me to App Inventor. Also, my own research is closely related to this idea. Security is a big concern these days.
  A large class of security vulnerabilities are due to errors in code. As part of my research I am currently designing a methodology
  that will enable developers to specify mobile apps in a visual language, perform security analysis and generate source code -- secure by construction. 
  I believe that working for App Inventor over the summer will give me ideas about my own research since I am also thinking of a visual platform for my methodology</p>

<h2 id="Q2">Proposed summer project</h2>
 <h4>Synopsis</h4>

<p>
  Components are the building blocks of app inventor. They can be visible i.e. they are part of UI interface or they can be non visible i.e they are not part of the UI screen but provide access to built-in functions of the device. All components in app inventor are part of some screen or activity which means that if the screen is not visible or the screen is destroyed by the Android system, the components stop running. An example of this is the Pedometer component which stops running when the phone screen is off. Ideally, a pedometer app would want to keep running once started in the background until the user of the app explicitly stops it. To enable such behavior it is necessary to run such components on a thread separate from the UI thread in the background.  
</p>
<h4>Benefits to community</h4>
  <p>
    Enabling components to run in a background process will allow app inventor developers to build more sophisticated apps. By leveraging the ability to schedule tasks to run in the background, developing with app inventor will take the community a step closer to native android development.

<h2 id="Q3">Interest in introductory programming</h2>
<p>I worked 3.5 years as a Programmer Analyst for Cognizant Technology Solutions in India. Out of the 3.5 years I spent 2.5 years
  making web applications which included programming in Java, JSP/Servlet, Ajax, JavaScript. In my graduate program I have worked
  extensively on Anroid. I developed an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.ksu.cis.bse_a4m_android&hl=en">app</a> available in Google Play.
  The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/JoyMitra/apps-4-vet-med/tree/master/bse-a4vm/android">here</a>. I have also dabbled with compiler technology and built a compiler for Extended Static Java
  along with a transpiler that translates Extended Static Java Programs into C. I also built a Garbage Collector for C programs. The source code is availabe <a href="https://github.com/JoyMitra/Java2CTranspiler">here</a>.
  I have also written automated tests (JUnit) for all my projects. A sample of Android tests are available <a href="https://github.com/JoyMitra/apps-4-vet-med/tree/master/bse-a4vm/android/app/src/androidTest/java/edu/ksu/cs/a4vm/bse">here</a>.
  A sample of tests I wrote for the JavaToC Transpiler are available <a href="https://github.com/JoyMitra/Java2CTranspiler/blob/master/compiler-team-project/src/test/java/esj/test/CcodegeneratorTest.java">here</a>.
  I am currently working on vulnerability analysis in Android. It is a private repository hence I cannot share it publicly for now. 
  If you want to see samples of the work I have done there, you can send me a private email and I can share some of it. I have also been
  working on a design methodology for building secure Android apps. Here is a link to the <a href="https://joymitra.github.io/preventive-approach-securing.pdf">vision paper</a>
  As an aside I have been a teaching assistant on courses involving C programming and automated software testing.</p>

<h2 id="Q4">Experience with development tools</h2>
<p>I have worked on Eclipse, IntelliJ, Android Studio, Bash Shell, Code Analysis tools like Lint and PMD, Testing frameworks like JUnit and Pytest</p>

<h2 id="Q5">Experience with teams, online developer communities, and large code bases</h2>
<p>I worked for 3.5 years for a large software company. I was part of 2 large teams there. Also, always I had to make enhancements to existing code bases. I am used to setting up and going through large codebases</p>
